                <h2>About this page and me!</h2>
                <p>Hey there, you can call me Delvan with a silent D! I&apos;m a wrench by day, a streamer by night, and I like to play around with coding when I get the chance! A couple of years ago I decided to go from watching people stream content, to streaming content myself! I quickly learned that there are a ton of fun tools out there to enhance and customize your stream. I also quickly learned that I wanted to do a lot without having to sign up for twenty different services or run a dozen different apps. In my line of work I have always relied on the KISS method. Keep It Simple Stupid!</p>
                <p>That&apos;s where <a href="https://mixitupapp.com/" target="_blank">Mix It Up</a> came in to play! I can&apos;t thank the creators of Mix It Up enough for making this FREE tool. Mix It Up, in my opinion, is geared towards three things: automation, customization, and integration. It can act as a bot, responding to commands in chat, create and display overlays on top of your stream, and it can integrate with lots of different software and services. With recent updates I can now migrate even more of the code I run, directly into MIU and I can easily share more of what I&apos;m making with others.</p>
                <p>I might not be a great streamer and I might be terrible at design but I really enjoy making things and sharing them with anyone that might find a use for them. Down below you&apos;ll find a list of the overlays, commands, and other things I&apos;ve made for streaming.</p>
